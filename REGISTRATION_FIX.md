## ✅ SOLUTION: Fresh Excel File Created

I've successfully:
1. ✅ Deleted the old/corrupted Excel file  
2. ✅ Restarted the backend server
3. ✅ Server automatically created a fresh `cybernova_registrations.xlsx`
4. ✅ Added `nodemon.json` to prevent server restarts during saves

## 🧪 Next Step: Test Registration

Please test the registration now:

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:5173/register
2. **Fill the form** with test data
3. **Submit** the registration
4. **Check admin portal**: http://localhost:5173/admin (password: `cybernova2026`)

The Excel file is now fresh and ready. If you still see issues, let me know what error message appears!
